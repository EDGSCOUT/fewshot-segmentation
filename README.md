# [On the Texture Bias for Few-Shot CNN Segmentation]()

This repository contains the code for deep auto-encoder-decoder network for few-shot semantic segmentation with state of the art results on FSS 1000 class dataset and Pascal 5i. This method embeds different ferequncy information in the CNN representation to overcome with the texture bias and applies bidirectional convolutional LSTM layers to perform non-liner parametric k shot setting for few-shot semantic segmentation.
